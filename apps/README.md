Self-contained sample applications for Algernon
===============================================

Give an .alg file as the first argument to algernon to run it.

* `first.alg` just displays a simple message.
* `64-bit_linux/withplugins.alg` runs a Go plugin that is compiled for 64-bit Linux.
* `single.alg` is an example of defining all handlers in a single Lua file.

(`.alg` files are `.zip` files. It's the equivalent of `.war` files for Java.)
